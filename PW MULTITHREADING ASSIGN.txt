
1. What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?
* Improve efficiency: utilizes CPU resources better.
* Save times: Allows parallel execution of tasks. Reduces overall processing time.
* Improve responsiveness: allows Programs to remain interactive while performing a heavy task
* Optimizes resources usage: Allows better for better management of resources.
* In simple terms, multithreading helps programs work faster and smoother by doing multiple things at once.
2. What are the benefits of using Multithreading?
* Improve Responsiveness
* Save times
* Improve performance
* Efficient resource uses
* Faster execution
3. What is Thread in Java?
* In simple Thread is a process in Java. 
* It executes a small portion of a program.
* A thread can run independently and concurrently with other threads.
* Each thread in the program has its own path of Execution.
4. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java?
* There are two ways to implement a thread that is
* 1) By Extending multiple thread classes.
* 2)BY implementing a runnable interface.
5. What's the difference between thread and process?
* Process
> Has its own memory space and resources
> Heavier, more time-consuming to create and manage
> Allocate resources by the operating system.
* Thread
> Threads share memory space and resources with other threads in the same process.
> Lighter, quicker to create and switch between.
> Uses resources to allocate to its parent process.
6. How can we create daemon threads?
* Daemon Threads are run in the Background of other threads
* It provides services to the main thread 
* Examples like Garbage Collectors, finalizers, signal dispatchers, etc.
* Methods:-
* A) public final void set Daemon(Boolean b)
* B) public final Boolean is Daemon()
* Program
Class Example Extends Threads{
 Public void run(){
	Sysout(“child thread”);
}
Psvm(){
Sysout(“MAIN THREAD”);
Test t =new Test();
t.setDaemon(true);
t.start();
}
}
7. What are the wait() and sleep() methods?
* Wait() method is to make a thread wait for another thread to do something.
* Sleep() method is to pause the thread execution for some duration

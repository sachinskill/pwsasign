
1. Program to display current date and time in Java
* check datatime.java file

2. Write a program to convert a date to a string in the format "MMIddlyyyy".
* check datetostring.java file
3. What is the difference between collections and streams? Explain with an Example.
* Collections:
> Collections are a memory hierarchy frame that contains a set of interfaces and classes.
> Collections are used to store, add, delete, retrieve, and manipulate the data.
> The collection can be modified or reused.
* Streams:
> Streams are an API introduced in java8.
Streams are sequences of objects and support various methods.
> Streams are used to process a collection of objects.
> Streams are not data structures and can not modified, they operate on existing data structures. Examples like arrays, collections
4. What are enums in Java? explain with an example.
* Enums were introduced in Java 1.5. Enums are used whenever we have a set of values or predefined named constants that we don't want to change.
* It's a special type of class used to define a collection of constants. They provide a way to represent a fixed set of values that don't change throughout the process.
* Example
Public enum Coffeesize{
	large,
	medium,
	small   	}
5. What are in-built annotations in Java?
* In-built annotations in Java are predefined annotations in Java language.
That provides Metadata about the code to the compiler and the runtime Environment.
* Here are the main in-built annotations in Java
> @Override
Helps to catch errors if the method doesn't actually override as intended.
> @Depricated
Marks a method or class as a deprecated means suggesting it should no longer be used.
> @FuntionalInterface
Indicates that the interface is intended to be functional interface (with a single abstract method)
